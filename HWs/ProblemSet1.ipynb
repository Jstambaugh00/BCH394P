    "Assume for simplicity that one nucleotide takes one byte of storage on a computer. Could I store my entire genome on my cell phone’s 100 gigabyte SD card (1 GB is 109 bytes)? In spite of the first human genome sequence costing a billion dollars, it is now technologically & economically possible to sequence a complete human genome for ~$1000, and the price is still dropping. How much would it cost to sequence the genome of everyone in the US newly diagnosed with cancer in a given year? You can find up-to-date cancer statistics here: https://www.cancer.gov/about cancer/understanding/statistics How much space would it take to store those genomes? Round your answer to the nearest petabyte (PB, 1015 bytes). For comparison, the UT TACC supercomputer has a storage capacity of ~160 PB. "
